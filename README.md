# Napier-Bank-Message-Filtering-Software
Napier Bank Message Filtering Service is a message filtering application, which accepts input in the form of SMS, email or Tweet messages. The application writes incoming messages into a file in JSON format. The application is able to automatically identify the type of incoming message and dynamically alter the layout of the window depending on the required fields. Textspeak found in SMS and Tweet messages is automatically expanded (i.e. LOL becomes 'Laughing Out Loud') and URLs found in email messages are automatically quarantined.
